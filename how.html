            <p>Yes. You can enroll up to 10 eligible Visa Business cards under a single login if you are the business owner or if you are authorized by the business owner to enroll multiple cards. Only the cardholder who enrolled the cards will receive email communications about the program and can access the password protected section of the program website. To allow multiple cardholders to receive emails about the program and have account access on the program website, each card must be enrolled separately under a different email address. Then, each enrolled Visa Business card will be treated as a separate account and the discounts received for each qualifying purchase will appear on the account statement for the Visa Business card used to make the qualifying purchase.</p>

            <p> It's easy. Just follow these simple steps:<br>
              <br>
              1. Enroll your eligible Visa Business card(s) online at <a href="https://www.visasavingsedge.com" target="_blank">www.visasavingsedge.com</a><br>
              <br>

              <br>
              3. Receive confirmation from Visa that your card(s) is/are enrolled in Visa SavingsEdge.<br>
              <br>
              4. Make qualifying purchases at participating merchants with active discount offers. Click here for more information on qualifying purchases.<br>
              <br>
              5. The discount amount will be automatically calculated based on the merchant offer terms (please see Merchant Offers for current merchant offers).<br>
              <br>
              6. You will then receive the discount as a statement credit posted on a future Visa Business Credit and/or Check Card statement. </p>

            <p>The discount amount is automatically calculated based on the specific merchant offer terms.

Visa's service provider monitors millions of emails daily with feeds from multiple partners (e.g. Microsoft, AOL/Netscape, EarthLink, Internet browsers and proprietary feeds) and has standing orders to shut down confirmed fraudulent sites.
